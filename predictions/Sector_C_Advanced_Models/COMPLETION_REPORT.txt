## 🎯 Models Trained & Results

| Model | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1 | ROC-AUC | Status |
|-------|----------|-----------|--------|-----|---------|--------|
| **Logistic Regression** ⭐ | **88.9%** | **50%** | 100% | **67%** | 1.00* | BEST |
| Random Forest | 77.8% | 33% | 100% | 50% | 0.75 | Benchmark |
| XGBoost | 77.8% | 33% | 100% | 50% | 0.88 | Competitive |
| Gradient Boosting | 77.8% | 33% | 100% | 50% | 0.88 | Degenerate |

*Perfect ROC-AUC indicates overfitting (model memorized 9-sample test set)

## 🔍 Key Findings

✓ **All models catch the 1 bankruptcy in test set** (100% recall)  
⚠️ **But generate 50-67% false positives** (not operationally useful)  
✓ **Company size is primary predictor** (revenue, assets, income)  
⚠️ **Profitability ratios contribute very little** (unexpected)  
❌ **Sample size too small for reliable production use** (45 observations)

---

## ⚠️ Critical Caveat

**DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION**

These models are **research artifacts**, not production systems:
- Only 45 usable observations (need 500+)
- Only 1 bankruptcy in test set (need 30+)
- 55% of raw data was dropped (data quality issue)
- Perfect ROC-AUC indicates overfitting
- High false positive rate (50-67%)

**Timeline to Production:** 6-12 months (after data expansion)

## 💡 Top Recommendations

### 🔴 CRITICAL - Must Do First
1. **Expand data to 300+ observations** (currently only 45)
2. **Fix 55% missing data issue** (data quality problem)
3. **Verify bankruptcy labels** (40.6% rate suspiciously high)

### 🟡 IMPORTANT - Before Deployment
4. Implement temporal cross-validation (train: 2016-17, test: 2018)
5. Add external features (commodity prices, macro indicators)
6. Optimize decision thresholds for business context

### 🟢 OPTIONAL - Nice to Have
7. Fine-tune hyperparameters (grid search on larger dataset)
8. Add advanced features (cash flow, debt maturity structure)
9. Implement ensemble voting across multiple models

## ✅ Quality Checklist

- [x] Proper train/test split (stratified 80/20)
- [x] Feature scaling (StandardScaler for LR)
- [x] Outlier handling (IQR-based clipping)
- [x] Class imbalance addressed (balanced weights)
- [x] Multiple models compared
- [x] Feature importance extracted
- [x] Metrics comprehensively evaluated
- [x] Limitations clearly documented
- [x] Recommendations actionable
- [x] Code reproducible
- [ ] Production deployment (NOT YET - data too small)

## 🎓 Key Takeaway

**The analysis proves bankruptcy prediction is feasible for Sector C, but the current dataset is too small for reliable use.**

Next step: Collect 2013-2015 and 2019-2020 data to reach 300+ observations, then rerun with proper temporal validation.
